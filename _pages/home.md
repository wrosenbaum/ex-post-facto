Hello, and welcome! I am an assistant professor of computer science at Amherst College. My main research interests are in theoretical computer science, particularly distributed computing, the design and analysis of efficient algorithms, and computational complexity.

Before coming to Amherst, I had postdoctoral positions in the [Algorithms and Complexity group](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/algorithms-complexity) at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany hosted by [Christoph Lenzen](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~clenzen/), and in the School of Electrical Engineering at [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il/) hosted by [Boaz Patt-Shamir](https://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~boaz/). I completed my PhD in the [mathematics department](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) at UCLA under the supervision of [Rafail Ostrovsky](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/), and I did my undergrad at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu/).

When I am not exploring the theoretical boundaries of computation, I enjoy cooking, playing piano, hiking, taking pictures, snowboarding, and brewing beer. I currently live in Amherst with my wife Alivia, our daughter Ione, dog Finnegan, and two cats, Pip and Posy.
