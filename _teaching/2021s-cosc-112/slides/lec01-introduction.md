# Introduction & Recursion

## Agenda
1. Course Introduction and Structure
2. Recursion

# Course Introduction and Structure

## What do you know?

- basic data-types and variables `int`, `char`, `String`, `boolean`
- if-then-else statements
- iteration (`for` and `while` loops)
- arrays and strings
- defining and using methods


## What will this course cover

- objected oriented design: defining and creating `class`es, class hierarchy
- generic programming: interfaces, abstract classes and methods
- simple data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues
- recursion, randomization, and other topics

## Course philosophy

- emphasize general *design principles*
- generic conceptual tools for how to solve problems
    - identify small sub-tasks that should be solved
- technical tools to code implementations
- offer greater opportunities for creative expression

## What will you do?

- weekly lab assignments (~25%)
- monthly projects (3 total) (~30%)
- weekly quizzes (~25%)
- **actively participate** (~20%)
    - discussion in lecture
	- accountability groups


## Weekly Rhythm

- Monday: start working on lab/project, attend lab session
- Tuesday: prepare for lecture: reading, videos, etc.; write some code
- Wednesday: lecture and debrief
- Thursday: prepare for lecture; write some code
- Friday: lecture and debrief; turn in assignment; look at following assignment

## How will you do it?

- work collaboratively, but don't share code
- participate in discussion
    - Moodle forums
    - Slack channel
- interact with posted materials (readings, videos, etc)
    - assume everything is required, unless marked with **IYI**

# Synchronous Meetings

## Lecture format

- not really a lecture
    - typically short introduction
- work in small groups on problems
- rejoin larger group to discuss solutions
- **you must prepare by engaging with course materials before lecture**


## You might not like the format (compared to lectures)

[Studies indicate](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/39/19251?cid=nwsltrtn&source=ams&sourceId=5078450) you might feel:

- sessions are disjointed and lacking flow
- there are frequent interruptions to work
- concerned errors you make won't be corrected
- general feeling of frustration and confusion


## But this format is effective

## The moral

Learning probably doesn't feel the way you think it should:

> [W]hen students experienced confusion and increased cognitive effort with active learning, they perceived this disfluency as a signal of poor learning, while in fact the opposite is true.

-- [Deslauriers et al. 2019](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/39/19251?cid=nwsltrtn&source=ams&sourceId=5078450)

## Zoom for group discussion

- you will spend much of the lecture time working in breakout groups on Zoom
- you will be given a prompt (Google doc)
- you might be asked to code too
- you might be asked to share main points of discussion with class

# Work Outside of Class

## Collaboration

- collaboration is encouraged
- for work you will submit (labs/projects) **do not share code**
- discuss problems on a conceptual level

## Web Resources

- there are many good resources out that help teach concepts, e.g.,
    - [Oracle Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
    - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)

- there are many forums where you could find code that solves your problems (e.g., StackOverflow)
    - often do more harm to your learning
	
no matter what: **always credit your sources** (comments in code)

## Getting Help

- lab and lecture sessions
- Moodle forums and Slack channel
- evening TA sessions (MW 7--9pm)
- office hours
    - drop-in
    - by appointment
- email (if other channels are not appropriate)
- peer tutoring available

## Grading & Academic Integrity

**Course Goals.** For you to acquire skills relevant to your life; to challenge you and support your learning.

- to do my job, I need to be able to assess your (individual and collective) understanding as clearly as possible
- assessment is reflected in grades
- attempting to gain an unfair advantage in grading undermines everyone's work in the class
- no long-term benefit to cheating, larger long-term risks 
   + short term risk: failing assignment/course, possible disciplinary action by the college
   
## Bill & Ted's Rule

> Be excellent to each other!

## Remark on Code

Code serves two purposes:

1. get the computer to do what you want
2. convey your *intent and implementation* to someone reading your code
    + clear organization
	+ sensible, consistent naming conventions
	+ comments describing functionality, usage, and trickier bits of code

## Lab Extensions

- programming is a creative endeavor
- opportunity to go beyond following instructions
- solve problems relevant or interesting to you
- grading is subjective
    + typically effort and care you put into an assignment are clear
