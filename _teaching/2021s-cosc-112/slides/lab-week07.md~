# Substitution Ciphers

## Secrecy

Since ancient times, people have relied on secret storing and transmission of sensitive information:

- Military secrets
    + coordination
	+ battle plans
- Secret diary
- Secure payments (e.g., debit/credit card transactions)
- ...

## Setup

- start with **cleartext** message
    + message that contains sensitive info
- want to generate a **ciphertext**
    + obscures sensitive info in cleartext
	+ cleartext can be recovered from ciphertext
	    - but only if you know how!
    + **key** is secret that allows one to recover cleartext
	    - key might be e.g., password

## Ciphers and Keys

A **cipher** is a method of generating ciphertext from cleartext and vice versa

More formally, a cipher has two methods:

1. `encrypt : (cleartext, key) -> ciphertext`
2. `decrypt : (ciphertext, key) -> cleartext`

We require

- if cleartext encrypted and decrypted with same key, get the same message back

We hope

- without key, it is hard recover cleartext from ciphertext


## Example: Caesar Cipher
