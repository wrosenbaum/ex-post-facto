### Course Description

This course 

### Expected Background

-- comfortable writing Java
-- basic data structures and their uses
-- big O notation

### Text and Topics

**Suggested text:** *The Art of Multiprocessor Programming* by Herlihy, Shavit, Luchangco, and Spear. The course will follow this text fairly closely, though it will not strictly be required. The core topics covered in the course include:

- mutual exclusion,
- concurrent objects,
- locks and contention resolution,
- blocking synchronization,
- concurrent data structures (linked lists, queues, stacks, hash tables, and sets, skiplists and balanced search)
- scheduling, work distribution, and barriers,
- data parallelism (MapReduce and streams).

As time allows, we may cover additional topics such as the theoretical foundations of shared memory, sorting networks, fault tolerance, message passing models, and distributed graph algorithms.


### Coursework

#### Coding/Lab Assignments (~20%)

#### Written/Theoretical Assignments (~20%)

#### Written Quizzes (~20%)

#### Class Participation and Group Work (~10%)

#### Final Project (~30%)

### Collaboration

The coursework will consist of a mixture of group and individual assignments. You are encouraged to discuss and collaborate throughout the course, although some submitted work should be completed individually.

#### Individual Work

**All quizzes and lab assignments must be submitted individually.** For the quizzes, you are encouraged to study/prepare in groups. However, once you begin a quiz, you are expected not to communicate with others (in the class or not) until you submit the quiz. You should not discuss the contents of a quiz with anyone who has not yet completed the quiz.

For the lpab assignments, you are encouraged discuss the problems and work together on a conceptual level. However, you are expected to write and submit your own code. In particular, **you may not share your code for lab assignments with fellow students, nor ask others (whether enrolled in the course or not) to write code on your behalf.** 

#### Small Group Work

Written assignments and the final project can be completed by groups of up to 4 students. For the written assignments, a single document should be submitted for the group. The document should indicate the role of each student in preparing the submission, or indicate that all students share equal responsibility for the submission. If the group members feel that they deserve unequal credit for the assignment, this should be indicated on the submission as well.

### Academic Honesty
