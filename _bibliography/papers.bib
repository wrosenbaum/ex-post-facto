	abstract  = {In 1976, Knuth asked whether the worst-case running-time of the Gale-Shapley algorithm for the Stable Marriage Problem can be improved when non-sequential access to the input is allowed. Partial negative answers were given by Ng and Hirschberg and as part of Segal's general communication-complexity analysis. We give a far simpler, yet significantly more powerful, argument showing that $\Omega(n^2)$ Boolean queries of any type are required for finding a stable --- or even approximately stable --- marriage. Unlike Segal's lower bound, our lower bound generalizes additionally to (A)~randomized algorithms, (B)~allowing arbitrary separate preprocessing of the women's and men's respective preferences profiles, (C)~related problems, e.g., whether a given pair is married in every/some stable marriage, (D)~whether a proposed marriage is stable or far from stable. To analyze ``approximately stable'' marriages,  we introduce the notion of ``distance to stability'' and provide an efficient algorithm for its computation.},
